// PromoteSoftwareSourceToLifecycleStageDetails A versioned custom software source OCID (softwareSourceId)
// is required when promoting software source content to
// lifecycle stage rank one. Software source content must be
// promoted to lifecycle stage rank one before being
// eligible for promotion to subsequent lifecycle stages,
// else an error is returned. Software source content is
// expected to be promoted in order starting with
// lifecycle stage rank one, followed by rank two, then rank
// three and so on.
// When promoting software source content to lifecycle stage
// rank two, three, four or five, softwareSourceId is optional.
// If a softwareSourceId is provided for a lifecycle stage
// between two and five, the system validates that the
// softwareSourceId is already promoted to the previous lifecycle stage.
// If the softwareSourceId from the previous lifecycle stage
// does not match the provided softwareSourceId an error returns.
// If a softwareSourceId is not provided for a lifecycle stage
// between two and five, the system promotes the
// softwareSourceId from the previous lifecycle stage. If the
// previous lifecycle stage has no SourceSource content
// an error returns.
